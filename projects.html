            <h3>Project 1</h3>
            <p>The first project is related to develop a single Web page using
                only two technologies: HTML and CSS. The project consists in
                creating a single web page with a menu at the top know as
                Navigation Bar. We have to include text describing ourself and
                text describing the project. Additionally, we need to include
                two images: one image is of ourself and second image is anything
                related to the project itself.</p>

            <h3>Project 2 - Sorcerers and Citadels</h3>
            <p>This project was for the class COMS309 I took in Spring 2024.
                THis project is a semester-long mobile application that myself
                and a team of 3 other peers created. Our application was a
                fantasy-themed <em>Monopoly</em>-inspired game. This project
                required multiple users to be able to play concurrently, with
                the ability to have multiple game lobbies happening simultaneously.
                My contribution to the project was primarily in the backend. I
                was the main backend developer and database designer. You can view a
                overview video <a href="https://youtu.be/pogpg6qTQu0" target="_blank">here</a>.
